# Gee Golly, Gee Wilikers It's Chunky Bacon

Howdy there. We'd like you to do a redesign of our Order system using the Twitter Bootstrap.

1) Use the Twitter Bootstrap Styles to re-design the Chunky Bacon Corps site, including the home page. You can add content, move text around, and use any of the elements available to you in the bootstrap or other assets from the web. Be sure you style all the views so your client is happy.

Be sure to style the entire site, views, forms, tables, or any other applicable views.

2) Using Bootstrap's built in Javascript plugins:

- Add a tooltip anywhere in a paragraph or list where the word 'bacon' appears. Find or make up a fact about bacon that will appear in the tooltip.

- Take the 3 images on the bottom of the home page and make them appear in an image carousel.

- Style all notices and error messages as Alerts, and apply the alert javascript. Notices show on successful save. A form error can be created on the new order view by attempting to create an order without setting a quantity.

- Put some of the homepage text into collapsable items, or Tabs, so it is better organized.

- Use JS Buttons w/a loading state for any forms

3) Make any changes within your power to better clean-up and organize this application. You can change any files you want including controllers and routes.
